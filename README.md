## About This Repository

The scripts in this repository is developed for the purpose of analyzing transcriptome data generated using the PacBio(R) [Iso-Seq(TM) protocol](http://www.smrtcommunity.com/Share/Protocol?id=a1q70000000HqSvAAK&strRecordTypeName=Protocol). 


This code is not part of the official PacBio software package and is developed solely by Elizabeth Tseng. The official software version is the RS_IsoSeq protocol.
